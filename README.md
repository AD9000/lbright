# lbright
A simple script to adjust the brightness of your linux desktop screen.

The idea originated from the fact that on my laptop (running lubuntu), the brightness controls just put a black fiter on top of the screen making it harder to see it. Combined with other permission/function issues, it was a pain. So I wrote a script for it! Feel free to use it/tweak it.

In case you dont have sudo rights for some reason, say you're on a school/work linux machine? try xlbright. Cheers!

##### TODO:
1. Convert the numbers to a percentage.
2. Testing on multiple systems!
3. Connect it to the brightness buttons on the keyboard
4. Add nightshift
5. Map them together with switches for each
