# lbright
A simple script to adjust the brightness of your lubuntu desktop screen.

The idea originated from the fact that on my laptop, the brightness controls just put a black fiter on top of the screen making it harder to see it. Combined with other permission/function issues, it was a pain. So I wrote a script for it! Feel free to use it/tweak it.

In case you dont have sudo rights for some reason, say you're on a school machine? try xlbright. Cheers!
